---To-do---

-Soon-
Add starry sky background :)
Star map

-Later-
yyyy-mm-dd time tracker
Satellites and other launchable craft
Satellite "orbit" behavior
Orbit selector for launched craft
Population tracker
Civilization scale tracker


---Gameplay Loop---
Start at Type 0.75 Civilization with 8,000,000,000 population
Launch craft to the moon. Craft include satellites, orbiters, stations, planetary bases, and planetary settlement modules.
Craft can be set on specific orbits such as circular, elliptical, geostationary, polar, as well as free return trajectories, cycler orbits, lagrange point orbits, etc.
Mine resources from each planet
Use rockets at first, but eventually surface to space vehicles, to transport mined materials to orbiting stations, satellites, and carriers
Use resources to build faster, larger, and better craft as well as to build larger planetary bases and eventually terraform
